# LINEAR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS-EXPERIMENT1
#  DC,AC and Transient Analysis of CS Amplifier
##  Introduction
The Common Source (CS) amplifier is a fundamental building block in analog circuit design, known for its voltage amplification capabilities. It utilizes an NMOS transistor where the input signal is applied to the gate, the output is taken from the drain and the source is common to both.A key feature is its ability to provide significant voltage gain, making it suitable for amplifying weak signals. The CS amplifier inverts the input signal that is there is a 180-degree phase shift between the input and output.It offers a high input impedance, which is beneficial for minimizing loading effects on the signal source. Here the circuit is biased using a DC voltage source(1.8V) and an input of AC signal is applied to the gate. CS amplifier analysis necessitates examining its static(DC) behavior,dynamic(AC) behavior and its time-domain(transient) response.
## Objective:
Determining its DC biasing conditions,voltage gain, input impedance, output impedance and observing the phase relationship between the input and output signals and frequency response.
## Key components used
Voltage source(DC): Its inteded use is to provide a DC bias voltage to the gate of the MOSFET.

AC input: Controls drain current and enables amplification.

Resistor: The resistor acts as a pull-up resistor for the output node.
